                    <p>Mortals, they doth comprise the greater number of this continent's folk, save the demonic. Brief is their time, yet swift their ascent, knowledge passed as torch to kin, thus do they raise up civilizations. 'Tis said they are a race that leaveth countless remnants. Through fellowship, mankind did spread the arcane arts across the land, and is hailed as the vanquisher of the Demon King.
                    </p>

                <li class="item-2">
                    <h1>Elves</h1>

                    <p>Elves, a folk of ageless grace, and dwindling number, oft touched by sorcery. Time's passage, to them, is but a whisper, unlike the fleeting lives of men. Their years stretch long, 'tis true, yet ancient butcheries by the Demon King's hand have scattered them to solitude. Centuries may wane ere kin they meet again. Their endless days breed detachment and a gulf from mortal passions, though such fate be not universal.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="item-3">
                    <h1>Demons</h1>

                    <p>Demons, beings of sorcery and cruel intellect, are devoid of kinship, compassion, and empathy. Their lives stretch long, attuned to the currents of mana, yet their alien minds bar true accord with mortal races. Language is but a tool for deceit, masking ill intent behind false emotion. Their meritocracy, ruled by magical might, breeds an arrogance matched only by their aeons-long obsession with arcane power.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="item-4">
                    <h1>Fauna</h1>

                    <p>Hark, fauna doth encompass the beasts and wildlife of this world, divided into the tamed and the wild. They serve as resource for labor and sustenance, oft entwined in quests, such as to ensnare a Stille for magely trial. Lo, the European Dragon, the Labrador Retriever, and the Gargoyle, are but examples.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="item-5">
                    <h1>Flora</h1>

                    <p>Flora, 'tis plant life, natural and enchanted, that doth provide sustenance, medicaments, and arcane virtues. Though 'tis also the name of a puissant sorceress from Berserk, methinks the query veers towards Frieren. Know then, this concept oft blooms in fictional flowers, such as the Blue-Moon Weed, a most vital plot.</p>

                <li class="item-6">
                    <h1>Dwarves</h1>
                    <p>Dwarves, a stout folk, short of stature, yet long of years, nigh three centuries they endure. Craftsmen and warriors, skilled beyond measure, their beards are their pride, their diligence their strength, and tradition their guiding star. Such as Eisen, the hero's companion, and Voll, the mighty warrior.</p>
