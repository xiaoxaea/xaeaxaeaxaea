        <div class="class-1">
            <h2>Mages</h2>
            <p>--A mage, by the Continental Magic Association's writ, wields arcane arts, for ally's succor, combat's fray, or day's toil. Ranked they are, fifth-class marking true mastery. Schools they favor, though some grasp wider lore. By trial certified, mages are the world's crux, from guild's hearth to nation's war.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="class-2">
            <h2>Warriors</h2>
            <p>--A warrior, a lineage of souls bound to the dance of close combat, with steel as their partner. They, the vanguard, dealing blows and weathering tempests for their kin. Endowed with might, resilience, and swiftness, forged in the crucible of youth. Their burden: to wield the mightiest arms, clad themselves in unyielding armor, and invoke arts passed down through ages untold.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="class-3">
            <h2>Vanguards</h2>
            <p>--A vanguard, 'tis a frontline bulwark, shield against the fore, that the party may endure. Stark, a warrior of might, doth serve as vanguard for Frieren's company, a bulwark in strife, attack, and defence in equal measure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="class-4">
            <h2>Priests</h2>
            <p>--A Priest, a vessel of the Goddess' grace, doth wield enchantments of succor and mending. Yet, they are not defenseless, for combat magicks are theirs to command, and a natural ward against curses doth shield them. Bound to hallowed churches and clergy, they perform rituals to absolve the accursed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="class-5">
            <h2>Monks</h2>
            <p>--Hark, a Monk, a devout warrior, skilled in the art of unarmed combat. With martial prowess and keen strikes, they eschew steel and sorcery. Like unto Priests, they venerate the Creation Goddess, yet whether they wield her grace is unknown.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="class-6">
            <h2>Thieves</h2>
            <p>--Hark, the Thief, a vocation veiled in Frieren's tapestry, its arts yet to be fully known. Bound, it seems, by guilds of shadows, their craft lies in the disarming of wicked snares, such as the foul mimic.</p>
